# mqttsensor
MQTT sensor for ESP8266 and DHT11
Read values from DHT11 and send to MQTT server/broker. 
The DHT11 sensor is far from accurate and it is best to read several times and send the average value...
$$To be improved$$
Note this is Arduino code
The libraries folder is for the necesarry libraries. 
Remember to change the Additional board managers URLs to http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
The libraries should be added to the Sketchbook location.
